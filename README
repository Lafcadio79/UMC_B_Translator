ASSUMPTIONS  and CONSTRAINTS

- All class variables must have an initial value (unless initialised at object creation time).

- Signals Buffers have "[]" as initial value
- Data Buffers have "[]" as initial value

- suported types of UMC variables are 
   var: 0..n   := someliteral;
   var: int    := someliteral;
   var: int[]  := [];
   var: obj;   -- constant value initised statically (possibly at object instantiation time)
   
- Within a StateChart the names of simple states are unique.

- All transitions have simple states as source and target.

- Actions are plain assignments to variables, or sending of signals, or conditionals,
  
- Signals have at most one parameter of type int[][] with name "data"

- The first transition of the state machine diagram identifies the default initial state.

- if boolean conditions are just numerical relations  < > = >0 <=

- transition labels are UNIQUE in the system
